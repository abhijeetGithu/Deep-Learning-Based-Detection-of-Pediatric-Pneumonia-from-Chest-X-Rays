# Deep Learning-Based Detection of Pediatric Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust deep learning model to classify chest X-rays of pediatric patients as either showing signs of pneumonia or being normal. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the project aims to create an accurate and efficient diagnostic tool that can aid in the early detection of pneumonia, potentially improving treatment outcomes for children.

## Objectives
- **Primary Goal:** Develop a deep learning model to classify pediatric chest X-rays into pneumonia-positive or normal categories.
- **Secondary Goal:** Deploy the model for real-world usage in a clinical or diagnostic setting to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle and consists of labeled pediatric chest X-rays:
[**Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray).

### 2. Preprocessing
- Images were resized to a standard dimension to match the input size required by the pre-trained model.
- Normalization techniques were applied to scale pixel values.
- Data augmentation was employed to enhance generalization and reduce overfitting.

### 3. Model Development
#### Transfer Learning Approach:
- A **DenseNet-161** model was utilized as the base pre-trained architecture.
- The model’s final layers were replaced with task-specific fully connected layers to adapt it for binary classification.

#### Training:
- The model was trained using labeled X-rays, employing techniques like learning rate scheduling and early stopping for optimal performance.
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy.
- **Optimizer:** Adam.

### 4. Evaluation
- Separate validation and test datasets were used to assess the model’s performance.
- Key metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve

### 5. Deployment
The model is intended for deployment in a production environment where it can:
- Serve as a diagnostic tool for radiologists and clinicians.
- Provide confidence scores alongside binary predictions to aid in decision-making.

## Results
- The model achieved [state key metrics, e.g., 95% accuracy, 92% F1-score, etc.] on the test dataset.
- Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves were generated to analyze performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch
  - NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - OpenCV for image preprocessing
- **Pre-trained Model:** DenseNet-161
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Colab
